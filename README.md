# currencyconverter
A small website that lets you convert between different currencies.

#

* backend written in Go

* requests are handled using the net/http module (https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)

* HTML pages are served using the http/template module (https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/)

* conversion rates are requested from the fixer.io API (https://fixer.io/)

(the focus of this project was on developing a web backend server using Go, so the frontend may be unoptimized)
